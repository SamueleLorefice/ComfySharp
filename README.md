# Comfy Sharp
###### _A C# library for interacting with the ComfyUI Web API._

## Features
- Seamlessly works with all and any nodes in your own ComfyUI installation.
- Supports all ComfyUI API exposed endpoints.
- Provides a simple ComfyClient class for easy access to the API.
  - On initialization the client automatically builds an additiona assembly containing all the available nodes as classes. Also leaves available the source code for importing it in a project.
  - This assembly then gets loaded into the client.

## Usage
_Coming soon..._
